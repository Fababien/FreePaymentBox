FreePaymentBox
==============

Module for using Paybox in Prestashop 1.5 with no CGI module required, SHA512 used 

This is free software, and as such comes with NO WARRANTY.

This is an adaptator of Paybox Payment system for Prestashop.

Version is now 0.01 and then, plenty is to do. 

It already works on a real shop with real money.

To works you need
- php
- openssl
- a test account (provided by paybox) or a real customer test.

Admin part of the module is pretty ugly at this time
- mode_prod : 0 is for test, 1 is for production
- pbx_hash : is to be set to SHA512

Documentation, test account and public key are provided by Paybox and are needed. Those are supplied in Paybox download section.

This module is not made by Paybox and has no relation with Point Transaction Systems. 
Prestashop is not involved in this project.

Paybox, Point Transaction Systems and Prestashop are registred trademarks.

Before asking or agueing, remember that module is 'FREE' and that no one 'PAY' me :) 

Have a good journey
